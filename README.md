## Monthly Mess

## About
This is my submission for Neighborhood Hacks 2.

## Inspiration
Being a student myself, I've faced a really hard time searching for an authentic mess who meets my diet needs. Being tried a few yet never felt fulfilled because it is really next to impossible to find a perfect match. Not to talk about finding one in a new city.
So this is how I got the idea to build a simple application, which will help students or anyone living far away from their home to get the food as per their requirements.
It's like a mini search engine as well as a feedback database, I hope this will help others like me.
